## Overview

This Repository contains code which was created while solving challenges on Entwicklerheld.de . Its purpose is to show some codingexamples written by me.The examples are written over a timespan of 3 years ago and now.
Some of the Challenges don't allow to use every plain php function, framework or add-ons. So you will see a mixture of code which is written in plain code of the choosen language or with custom functions.
Challenges are ordered by the used technology and - if used - by framework.
Every Example code works fine in the context of the given challenges.

### Server Requirements

This Repositoies purpose is only viewing the code. So no Server-Requirements or further advises, sorry.
